# Fashion-Classification
Fashion Classification Using Deep Learning

In this project, we are going to predict fashion classes such as pants, shirts, and shoes from grayscale images.

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.
2.	Understand the theory and intuition behind artificial neural networks.
3. 	Train and test an artificial neural network model in Keras and TensorFlow.


### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Import Libraries and Datasets
- __Task 2:__ Perform Data Visualization
- __Task 3:__ Prepare the Data for Training
- __Task 4:__ Build a Deep Learning Model
- __Task 5:__ Compile and Train the Model
- __Task 6:__ Assess Trained Model Performance

### About the dataset:
The [__Fashion MNIST__](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist) dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and computer vision. It is designed as a replacement for the original MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits.

The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images, each measuring 28x28 pixels. These images represent various fashion items and are categorized into 10 classes: t-shirts, pants, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots.

Classes:  
0 = T-shirt/top  
1 = Trouser/pants  
2 = Pullover shirt  
3 = Dress  
4 = Coat  
5 = Sandal  
6 = Shirt  
7 = Sneaker  
8 = Bag  
9 = Ankle boot  

The dataset is divided into a training set with 60,000 images and a test set with 10,000 images. This separation allows you to evaluate the performance of your machine learning models on new, unseen data.

Fashion MNIST is commonly used as a benchmark for testing and comparing image classification algorithms. Its simplicity makes it ideal for educational purposes and for initial experimentation with image recognition tasks.
